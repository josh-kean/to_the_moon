Game Mechanics for To The Moon

//Purpose of Game//
The purpose of this game is to educate anyone who's interested about how blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and technology work. All the blockchains used in this game are real, and
all of the scenarios / situations in this game have happened.

//players//
Each player will be their own blockchain. The goal of the game is to have their price go "to the moon", in other words, to a set goal.

//start of game//
Each player will start as a genesis block with the following attributes; initial price, miners (5 each), mining reward, time to mine, halving schedule, and maybe more?

//Turns//
The following can happen to a player during their turn; change of price, change in mining power, change in hash rate, halving of reward.
At the start of each turn, a player draws a card that has an event on it and performs whatever action is on that card.
Next, a player rolls the mining dice to simulate the mining process. If the block is mined then the player can pull a mining reward card.

//Mining//
Mining in this game depends on 2 properties; number of miners and difficulty. The player subtracts the number of miners they have from the number 10 to determine how many dice they need to roll.
The player has a number that they want their dice to roll under. This is determined by multiplying their difficulty by 6 (for a maxumum of 60)

//Price//
The higher the difficulty, the higher your chance of the price going up. The inverse is true too, this is to simulate the value of a blockchains security. It may be easier to mine blocks with a lower
difficulty, but the chain is more succeptable to attack. The higher your price, the more miners you attract.

//Difficulty//
The more miners you have, the more your difficulty can go up. Eventually, your lack of miners will force your blockchain to lower in difficulty.

//Event Card//
An event card can be an on chain event or a real world event. Such examples are a politician tweeting about cryptocurrencies, a global shortage in mining hardware, a country going bankrupt,
a hack of another network. The goal is to effect the miner count, price, or difficulty of a blockchain at the start of a turn.

//Mining Cards//
same as event cards, but the effects are usually more extereme
